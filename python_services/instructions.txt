to activate the python server
1. navigate in terminal to python-service (cd python_service)

2. run 'venv\Scripts\activate'

3. run 'python tapo_python.py'

should see this:
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5000


first setup : 

1. navigate in terminal to python-service (cd python_service)
2. run 'venv\Scripts\activate'
3. pip install -r requirements.txt (execute this command in python_services)

when adding a new plug to the account/wifi, at the end, go to the tapo home app, go to "me" and go to "third-party compatiblity" and turn it off n on again (idk why but this is needed to avoid errors)

update all tapo plugs to latest
